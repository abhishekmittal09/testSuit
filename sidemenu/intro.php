                <li>
                Test your Instance : After you have installed Dlux for opendaylight, you can test your instance using this tool.
                </li>
                <li>
                Write you own Test Suit : You can also upload your test suit and test your instance.

            <h2 class="content-subhead">Aim of the Project</h2>
            <p>
                DLUX is the user interface for the Opendaylight Controller and the interface for YangUI. The aim of the project is to create
                a DLUX test Automation Tool to verify NETCONF actions originationg from DLUX.
            </p>

            <h2 class="content-subhead">Technologies</h2>
            <p>
                The tool would be web based and will use the following technologies :-
                <ul>
                    <li>Javascript, HTML, HTML5, CSS, Jquery, AJAX, Pure CSS - for UI rendering
                    <li>Test suites will use the Selenium2Library to automate UI actions</li>
                    <li>PHP for hosting and scripting</li>
                    <li>Robot Framework - for writing test suits</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h2 class="content-subhead">How would I proceed, in brief</h2>
            <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Step 1. Understand Robot framework, write some basic test suits and make them available to test newly installed instances</li> 
                <li>Step 2. Find out how the facility to change the existing test suits can be provided to the user and make it possible</li>
                <li>Step 3. Find out how the user can "EASILY" write their own test suits using this tool, with robot framework at the backend</li> 
            </ul>
            </p>

            <h2 class="content-subhead">Future Works</h2>
            <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Provide visualizations to analyze the results.</li> 
            </ul>
            </p>
